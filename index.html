                <p>
                    People who have been smoking for a long period of time are finding it harder to stop their habit. Nicotine withdrawals leave the smoker craving another cigarette causing harmful side effects to them and those around them. Our solution to this problem will provide users with an easy way to remind themselves of their goal and prevent them from giving in.
